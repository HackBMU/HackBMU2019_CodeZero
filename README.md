## Problem 

## Development server
According to a survey conducted by NDTV on Road Accidents in India **" 1 Person die every 4 Minute due to accidents"**
* The basic thing we are going to solve is to connect patients and accident victims with the ambulance service but there are many services which help to connect to these emergency services but it takes on an average, it takes around **8 mins to 14 mins**, due to this many don't get to avail these facilities in the required moment of time. 
* In countries like India where there is no separate lane for emergency services like Ambulance to travel to its destination and people in the roads are not informed about these things in advance in order to make the way which will help them reach the destination in the required time.

##  Solution
* Web App which can help to connect the victim to the nearest ambulance and from the ambulance to the hospital in **one click**
* Alert the users in the route about the incoming ambulance
